# 0x1D. C - Binary trees

This repository contains a C project focused on binary trees. The project is a collaborative effort by Alexandre Gautier and Thabiso Rantsho, with a weight of 5. It is scheduled to begin on October 30, 2023, at 6:00 AM and must be completed by November 3, 2023, at 6:00 AM. The checker for the project will be released on October 31, 2023, at 6:00 AM, and an auto-review will be launched at the deadline.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain the following concepts without relying on external resources:

- What is a binary tree
- The difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
- The potential time complexity benefits compared to linked lists
- Understanding the depth, height, and size of a binary tree
- Various methods for traversing a binary tree
- What constitutes a complete, full, perfect, and balanced binary tree

## Copyright and Plagiarism

It is essential to solve the project tasks independently to meet the learning objectives. Any form of plagiarism, including copying and pasting someone else's work, is strictly prohibited and will result in removal from the program.

## Requirements

### General

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All code files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, with specific options.
- All code files should end with a new line.
- A README.md file is mandatory at the root of the project folder.
- Code should adhere to the Betty style and will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl.
- Global variables are not allowed.
- Each code file should have no more than 5 functions.
- The standard library can be used.
- Prototypes of all functions should be included in the header file called binary_trees.h.
- Don't forget to push your header file.
- All header files should be include guarded.

### GitHub

One project repository should be created per group. Cloning, forking, or using a project repository with the same name before the second deadline may result in a 0% score.

## Data Structures

The project uses the following data structures and types for binary trees. These structures should be included in the header file:

- `binary_tree_t` for Basic Binary Tree
- `bst_t` for Binary Search Tree
- `avl_t` for AVL Tree
- `heap_t` for Max Binary Heap

## Print Function

A provided print function is used for visualization purposes but should not be pushed to the repository.

## Tasks

The project includes a series of tasks that involve working with binary trees. The tasks begin with creating a binary tree node and progress from there.

For detailed instructions on each task, please refer to the project's individual task descriptions.
